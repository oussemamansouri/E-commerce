# E-commerce
I created an E-commerce platform using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js). 
These technologies provided a robust and scalable solution. MongoDB efficiently stored and retrieved product information, while Express.js offered a flexible server-side framework.
AngularJS enhanced the user interface, creating a dynamic and interactive shopping experience.
Node.js ensured high performance and seamless communication between the server and client, resulting in a secure and feature-rich platform.
